# Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FVA Software is a convergent tool set in a form of desktop applications aimed at automating importing process of [Multimedia Data](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIADATA.md) (photo/audio/video)
into [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md) like [digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/) <img src="FVADocMD/Images/digiKam.png" alt="digiKam.png" width="20" height="20"/>, Google Photo, Apple Photo, [Synology Moments](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/moments) <img src="FVADocMD/Images/SynologyMoments.png" alt="SynologyMoments.png" height="20" />, etc. to make multimedia more fully-searchable as well as to refine family photos.
<img src="./FVADocMD/Images/InputAndOutputExamples.gif" alt="Input And Output Examples" />

# Capabilities
- **Organizing the multimedia:** Organizing the [Multimedia Data](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIADATA.md) to be more searchable
- **Multimedia metadata gaps identification:** It identifies the gaps and tries to fill it up (enriching the metadata and improving its consistency with minimal human involvement).
- **Integration:** The system is integrated with online/offline [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md):
[digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/) <img src="FVADocMD/Images/digiKam.png" alt="digiKam.png" width="20" height="20"/> as Offline [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md) and 
[Synology Moments](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/moments) <img src="FVADocMD/Images/SynologyMoments.png" alt="SynologyMoments.png" height="20" /> as Online [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md) are now supported. 
- **Supporting text search for [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md):** It is possible to search by events, photo author, places, people using text search 
- **Configuration:** The system flow depends on configuration.
- **Automating the import:** to decrease the probability of human factor influence on the process of importing new photos into the existing photo album;

Yes, I understood that despite many steps are automated, still human involvement is required.
