# Description
FVA Software (Photo-Video-Audio Software) is a convergent tool set in a form of desktop applications aimed at automating importing process of [Multimedia Data](https://github.com/dimanikulin/dimanikulin/blob/master/content/MultimediaData.md) (photo/audio/video)
into [Multimedia IR systems](https://github.com/dimanikulin/dimanikulin/blob/master/content/MultimediaIRSystems.md) like [digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/) 
<img src="./resources/images/digiKam.png" alt="digiKam.png" width="20" height="20"/>,
 Google Photo, Apple Photo, [Synology Moments](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/moments) 
<img src="./resources/images/synologyMoments.png" alt="SynologyMoments.png" height="20" />, 
etc. to make multimedia more fully-searchable as well as to refine family photos.
<img src="./resources/images/inputAndOutputExamples.gif" alt="Input And Output Examples" />

# Capabilities
- **Organizing the multimedia:** Organizing the [Multimedia Data](https://github.com/dimanikulin/dimanikulin/blob/master/content/MultimediaData.md) to be more searchable
- **Multimedia metadata gaps identification:** It identifies the gaps and tries to fill it up (enriching the metadata and improving its consistency with minimal human involvement).
- **Integration:** The system is integrated with online/offline [Multimedia IR systems](https://github.com/dimanikulin/dimanikulin/blob/master/content/MultimediaIRSystems.md):
[digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/) <img src="./resources/images/digiKam.png" alt="digiKam.png" width="20" height="20"/> as Offline [Multimedia IR systems](https://github.com/dimanikulin/dimanikulin/blob/master/content/MultimediaIRSystems.md) and 
[Synology Moments](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/moments) <img src="./resources/images/synologyMoments.png" alt="SynologyMoments.png" height="20" /> as Online [Multimedia IR systems](https://github.com/dimanikulin/dimanikulin/blob/master/content/MultimediaIRSystems.md) are now supported.
- **Supporting text search for [Multimedia IR systems](https://github.com/dimanikulin/dimanikulin/blob/master/content/MultimediaIRSystems.md):** It is possible to search by events, photo author, places, people using text search 
- **Configuration:** The system flow depends on configuration.
- **Automating the import:** to decrease the probability of human factor influence on the process of importing new photos into the existing photo album;
Despite many steps are automated, still human involvement is required. 

# Software Architecture Requirements

## Constraints
This section lists [constrains](./Constraints.md) and explanations for them. 

## Assumptions
This section lists all the assumptions with explanations for them. 
This is critical to do in order to cover all the gaps in the requirements.
| # | Assumption Description  | 
| - |:--------------:|
| 1 | It is assumed that the user, which the proposed solution is going to run under, has the write access to the [Google Photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos) (and other IR Multimedia systems) folder where [multimedia data](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-39940-9_1008) processed is going to be put in. | 
| 2 | User restarted the wizard after changing the configuration (because of feature of QTWizard and QTWizardPage) |

## Quality Attributes
This section lists quality attributes for target architecture.
So there are following Quality Attributes: **Conceptual Integrity**, **Maintainability**, **Reusability**, **Availability**, **Interoperability**, **Manageability**, **Performance**, **Reliability**, **Scalability**, **Security**, **Portability**, **Supportability**, **Testability**, **Learnability**, **Traceability**.

For more details please [see](./QualityAttributes.md)

## Hardware requirements
TBD

# Software Architecture Views

## Context View
The context diagram below shows the solution bounds and its interactions with other objects and subjects.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    B -->|Multimedia data| C(Online Multimedia IR system)
    B -->|Multimedia data| D(Offline Multimedia IR system)
    A(Photo Album owner) --> B(FVA Solution)
    A(Photo Album owner) --> D1
    A(Photo Album owner) --> D2
    A(Photo Album owner) --> D3
    D1(fa:fa-tablet Tablet) -->|Multimedia data| B(FVA Solution)
    D2(fa:fa-phone Phone) -->|Multimedia data| B(FVA Solution)
    D3(fa:fa-hdd-o External Disk) -->|Multimedia data| B(FVA Solution)
```
The solution is used during import of new multimedia content from external devices to an existing user photo album. 

The photo album owner is the main and only user of the solution. 

The external devices might be: 
- the phones with a camera; 
- the tablets with a camera; 
- the photo/video cameras;
- external storages (e.g., hard drive or flash card) with multimedia data;
- etc.

Once the multimedia data from the external devices is processed, the solution interacts with integrated online and offline Multimedia systems.

## Functional View

The Layered Architecture shall be applied to the system. 
Following layers are considered:

```mermaid
flowchart BT
    A(UI) --> B(Processing)
    B(Processing) --> C(Data and Configuration)
```
For more details please [see](./FunctionalView.md)

## Deployment View
The target installation folder shall have next folder structure:
* **#bin#** - a directory with all binaries (product one either third party);
* **#data#** - a directory to keep user populated dictionaries and application data;
* **#logs#** - a directory to keep the application logs. Each log file name shall start from name of process it was created by;
* **#scripts#** - a directory to keep all the scripts.

Installation must be possible at any target directory but not only in root folder.

TBD describe dependencies installed along with FVA Software.

TBD fvaParams.csv

# Programming Languages                         
Now C++ and Python are considered as main languages to implement FVA Software.

TBD - to describe for which cases C++ and for which Python.

# License
we use 3-rd party code here TBD link
and own licence is TBD

# Dependencies
Only open source [code/tools](./Dependencies.md) are used, as a product is **open source**.

There were other [dependencies](./DependenciesOld.md) but they got outdated.

# Code Style
Please see [here](./CodeStyle.md) for the rules to create and review the code.

# Code Documentation
Please see [here](./CodeDocumentation.md) for the rules to document the code.

# Implementation status
As of now, I have the **implementation status** for the following components:
- [Data processor](./FVADataProcessor/IMPLEMENTATIONSTATUS.MD)
- [Configurator](./FVAConfigurator/IMPLEMENTATIONSTATUS.MD)
- [Dictionary editor](./FVADictionaryEditor/IMPLEMENTATIONSTATUS.MD)

These references will give you an overview of the implementation status for each respective component.

| 4 | [Multimedia data](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-39940-9_1008)| Multimedia in principle means data of more than one medium. It usually refers to data representing multiple types of medium to capture information and experiences related to objects and events. Commonly used forms of data are numbers, alphanumeric, text, images, audio, and video. In common usage, people refer a data set as multimedia only when time-dependent data such as audio and video are involved.|
| 5 | Multimedia IR| Multimedia Information Retrieval (MIR) is an organic system made up of Text Retrieval (TR); Visual Retrieval (VR); Video Retrieval (VDR); and Audio Retrieval (AR) systems. So that each type of digital document may be analyzed and searched by the elements of language appropriate to its nature, search criteria must be extended.|
